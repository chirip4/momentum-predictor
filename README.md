# momentum-predictor â€” Balanced Ensemble Model for Bybit Futures

This project implements a **momentum trading predictor** for Bybit Futures, focused on the **1h timeframe** (adaptable).  
It includes automated OHLCV data fetching, feature engineering, and an ensemble of ML models optimized for class balance.

## âœ¨ Features
- Fetches up to **4 years of historical OHLCV data** (adaptative) from Bybit (bypasses API limits by iterative requests).
- Works with **CSV or live API**.
- Rich **feature engineering**: RSI, ATR, ADX, MACD, Bollinger, volume ratios, momentum.
- Uses a **balanced ensemble** of:
  - Random Forest
  - Extra Trees
  - Gradient Boosting
- Includes **walk-forward validation** with `TimeSeriesSplit`.
- Saves trained models, selected features, and configs to `.pkl` files.
- Adjustable threshold accounting for **trading fees**.

## Examples Output, Results and Saved Models

Trains multiple models with walk-forward validation.

Prints fold accuracies, AUC, optimal thresholds.

Saves models and configs to /models.
